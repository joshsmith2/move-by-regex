# In this file, please enter any paths (files or directories) you would like to
# be moved, relative to the source directory. You can specify the source
# using the -s flag (e.g move-by-regex.py -s /Volumes/Video)
#
# REGEX AND GLOBS:
# The character '*' will specify any input. For example, if the source
# directory is '/Volumes/Video', the following entry will move all folders
# with the structure
# /Volumes/Video/foot/<anything>/<anything_else>/bart:
# 
#   foot/*/*/bart
#
# In addition, any strings enclosed with 'regex{}' will be parsed as regex,
# so (for example) the following path will match all six digit folders
# starting with a 4 in the Projects directory:
#
#   Projects/regex{4[0-9]{5}}
#
# Note: You will need to double any backslashes used in regex patterns,
# unfortunately - so regex{(a|b)_is_\1} becomes regex{(a|b)_is_\\1}
#
# The regex interpreter used is python's 're' module; a good guide to possible
# patterns can be found at https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html
#
# All lines starting with a '#', incluing this one, will be ignored.
