# In this file, please enter any paths you would like to be moved, 
# relative to the source directory. You can specify the source 
# using the -s flag (e.g move-by-regex.py -s /Volumes/Video)
#
# You can use * to specify any path, and all lines starting with '#' will 
# be ignored. 
#
# For example, if the source directory is '/Volumes/Video', the following 
# entry will move all folders with the structure 
# /Volumes/Video/foot/<anything>/<anything_else>/bart:
# 
# foot/*/*/bart
#
# You can pass a list of file paths too:
# 
# foot/bart/brunt.txt
